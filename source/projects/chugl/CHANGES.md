# Changes

## 0.2.6 (alpha)

- NEW: Transparency!! (alpha-blended and sorted back to front). See examples/basic/transparency.ck
- NEW: Shadow Mapping (a basic first version)
  - Implemented shadow mapping for GDirLight and GSpotLight (GPointLight currently not supported)
  - See examples/deep/shadows.ck
- Reworked render graph API
  - `RenderPass` is now the base class of `ScenePass` (which renderas a GScene to a target texture, formerly this was called `RenderPass`) and `ScreenPass` (which renders a full-screen quad, useful for post processing effects)
  - Added new `RenderPass` methods `.clear()`, `.scissor()`, `.scissorNormalized()`, `.viewport()` and `.viewportNormalized()` 
  - Added `ScenePass.msaa(int)` which can be used to toggle MSAA antialiasing
  - Add resolution, time, delta_time, frame_count, mouse state, and chuck VM sample rate info to shader #FRAME_UNIFORMS. Simplifies writing generative shaders in shadertoy-style.
- UI improvements:
  - Add `UI.knob(...)` widgets
  - Add `UI.image(...)` and `UI.imageButton(...)` methods, which allow adding ChuGL Textures to UI. 
- Textures
  - Changed `TextureDesc.mips()` semantics. Set to `true` to generate a full mip chain, set to `false` to not create any mips beyond level 0.
  - Add `TextureDesc.resizable`, `TextureDesc.widthRatio` and `TextureDesc.heightRatio` to create resizable textures, i.e. textures that change in dimensions relative to window resolution. (helpful to make your app robust against changing screen sizes)
  - Add `Texture.write(int ptr)` which copies data from a pointer from a separate ChuGin. Use with caution!
  - change default surface texture to be non-srgb, add `OutputPass.gamma()` to control whether or not to apply gamma correction.
    - this simplifies getting accurate colors in basic 2D scenes without complex lighting. Before, all colors would get rendered into an srgb buffer meaning the user would have to manually convert them into *linear* space in their code. Now a simple `ScenePass` that outputs directly to the graphics window will preserve color values. For more details, read [this](https://medium.com/@tomforsyth/the-srgb-learning-curve-773b7f68cf7a).
- Bug fixes
  - fix `GGen.lookAt(vec3 pos)` bug when up vector and forward vectors were collinear. Added `GGen.lookAt(vec3 pos, vec3 up)` which takes a custom up vector.
  - fix `GText.defaultFont()` not setting custom font path correctly
  - fix segfault caused by sending large amount of data to `UI.plotLines()`
  - setting `TextureLoadDesc.gen_mips` to false no longer erroneously generates a mip chain
  - fix `UI.beginChild(...)` not properly returning a value
  - Add normal matrix to #DRAW_UNIFORMS shader include to enable correct calculations of normal vectors for Meshes with non-uniform scale
- GText: Add antialias method `GText.antialias()`
- New Examples
  - basic/transparency.ck
    - how to use transparent materials
  - rendergraph/slime.ck
    - slime mold simulation using compute passes!
  - deep/pokemon_cries.ck
    - Gameboy APU emulator that synthesis all Gen I pokemon cries!
  - deep/shadows.ck
    - shadowmapping for directional and spot lights!
- Under the Hood
  - Large architecture refactor to use a rendergraph + gpu resource cache + sorted drawcall structs to organize and dispatch GPU commands.
    - Inspired by [this blog](https://blog.mecheye.net/2023/09/how-to-write-a-renderer-for-modern-apis/) and the [noclip.website renderer](https://github.com/magcius/gfxrlz)
    - Caching GPU resources (namely BindGroups and TextureViews) significantly improves performance and increases the maximum number of draw calls that can be issued each frame

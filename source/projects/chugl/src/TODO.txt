TODO
- Shadow
  - add shadowNearPlane to SpotLight

- add file drag drop into GWindow (see Raylib model viewer example)

- finish split screen example
- test shadertoy example in release mode, make sure we still get shader compilation errors
  - is there a way to detect a compile error and switch to default magenta? otherwise just crash
- re-impl shader freeing gc
- impl screenPass properly and make a little chugl-shaderToy playground example
  - make actual chugl example.
  - use UI.text() as text editor field lol, or GText
- add pipeline/bindgroup gc for R_Shader
  - want to prevent memory leak from say CHydra building new shaders every frame
- check if imgui has multi-window support now for webgpu backend
- add anti aliasing back
- port geometry builders to use par_shapes
- GLTF loader!!!! (after adding GC?)
  - how does raylib do it? reference their pbr material system 

UI
- add nearest-neighbor filtering

- look into other blendmodes besides alpha blending
  - see acerola blend modes video
  - impl additive blending particle system example, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOfNgvQ93Q&ab_channel=NeverEngineStudios
    - also acerola particle system / compute shader video

- default GScene with a main camera?
- add inverse normal matrix to PER_DRAW instanced draw uniforms
- group all the commands of the frame together, submit all at once at end of RenderGraph 

- add back MSAA to rendergraph API, see if that fixes the appearance of audio_donut.ck

- ==optimize== for G_DrawCall sortkey, use the material AND shader index into arrays,
store 16 bits each (assumes we won't ever have more than 16k live materials and shaders),
lets us sort by shaders as well to minimize pipeline switches 
  - also add checks so we don't reset a pipeline/bindgroup that was already set


- there is a slow leak somewhere (500kb / min)
  - first: update to newer version of wgpu that fixes texture view leak
    - https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/releases/tag/wgpu-v23.0.1
    - hopefully this fixes
    - what's the point of Rust if it still leaks...
  - check if this happens with just chuck (no chugl gg.nextFrame())
  - check if happens with just empty gameloop
  - check if happens with just an event being fired every frame, but no chugl
  - if it happens on empty gameloop and NOT any of the chuck-only tests
    - add logging to arena reallocation, check if I'm forgetting to clear any of the arenas
      - not picked up by xcode leakcheck, suggests its coming from an arena resize
      - but the linear growth of the leak suggests its *not* an arena, because arenas double every time in size
        - but maybe the memory is only picked up by tracker when writing/reading??? (i believe this ithe case on windows, so you can init an arena to several gigs no problem, see ryan fleury post)
        - 
  -  ==Address all of this as part of the great chugl garbage collection refactor==
     - to prevent cycles, remove the GGen.getChild() method. Children GGens only point to their parent, to prevent refcount cycles
        - this way, disconnecting a subgraph will actually free the entire subgraph, because the leaf nodes of
        that subgraph will have refcounts of 0
     -  other resources to look at:
        -  how does box2c track memory? look at their API for requesting memory usage
           -  ideally ChuGL can do the same

### Long-Term
- C-port of webgpu-utils shader pipeline layout generator
- study Raylib opengl batcher, can chugl make use of a batcher?
- skeletal animation
  - see obsidian note
  - study raylib gltf importer and animator
    - added in last release v5.5 (see raylib release notes)
      - GenoView and BVHView (developing two amazing tools to visualize and test animations)
  - watch j.blow devlog implementing animation!
- study jdh retro games from scratch (minecraft, doom), impl as chugl examples?
- Implement C preprocessor as separate project, add to chugl shader processor
  - simple: determine in @group(0) frame uniforms which @groups(x) are used, so that when binding frame uniforms we can ignore unused;
    - this is a simpler than generaeting a WGPUPipelineLayout, it's just checking to see if a binding variable string name appears in
    the body of a vertex or frag shader
- for PBR, IBL
  - see webgpu-typescript-starter notes.txt
  - anything we can use from https://github.com/google/filament
- add more builtin-shapes
  - see raylib 3d mesh generator
  - https://prideout.net/shapes
- Swapping out for simpler libraries
  - swap out glm for handmade math
  - swap GLFW for https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW

=== Srgb format madness ===
Insightful blog post: https://medium.com/@tomforsyth/the-srgb-learning-curve-773b7f68cf7a
Leaving this as is for now because there are more important issues.

Problem:
- 3D pipelines need to be gamma aware, do lighting calculations in linear space, and then map back to srgb
  - in this case, scenepass outputs a linear space rgba16 color target
- 2D pipelines w/o lighting however are all in gamma-space, and if you enter a color like @(.3, .4, .5) you want it to show up as that exactly
  - colors are entered in srgb, and stay in that space, never going to linear.
  - in this case, scenepass should outputs srgb into an rgba8 buffer 
- FlatMaterial can be used in both 3D and 2D context, so how do we know whether to convert to linear space or not?
  - Depends on format of backbuffer textureview, on whether or not bloom/tonemapping is being applied...

Options
- force backbuffer to be linear / non-srgb, and add gamma correction to OutputPass (which should really be called Tonemap)
- add srgb/non-srgb option to texture.loadimage()
  - if it's loaded as srgb, we *dont* need to do the srgb-linear conversion upon sampling in shader
  - but then this complicates things because users need to manually and correctly load the right type of texture
    - but if AssLoader is good enough, maybe they won't ever need to do this...
- add option to create an srgb/linear texture view of the backbuffer

I think the move for now is to manually apply gamma curve in post-process, and default to a non-srgb backbuffer.
- the rendergraph for a 3D game with a 2D menu would look something like
  - root --> 3dScene --> bloom --> tonemap --> backbuffer
  - root --> 2dscene --> backbuffer
  - in both graphs, the backbuffer is non-srgb, and the tonemap pass applies its own gamma correction
- can revisit the texture loading format stuff when I implement the gltf loader
  - if it's simple 2D no lighting, we stay in gamma space and load the texture as RGBA8unorm
  - if we have lighting / tonemap / gamma correction, either
    - load texture as RGBA8Unorm-SRGB. the hardware will convert to linear when we sample in shader
    - OR
    - load as RGBA8Unorm, but convert manually in our shader code from srgb -> linear, so that when we apply the tonemap pass it goes back to srgb
  
=== Lighting and Shadows ========================

- remember to add and test inv normal matrix for correct shading on meshes with non-uniform or negative scale
  - see: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/transforming-objects-using-matrices/using-4x4-matrices-transform-objects-3D.html
- add spotlight and new pointlight attenuation factor to PBRMaterial shader


Ideas for multiple shadow casters
- 2darray and cubearray *winner winner*
- bindless XXXXX Not possible currently in webgpu (there is a proposal with deadline Dec 2026)
- screenspace shadows (these only augment directional lights, involve raymarching a z pre-pass. Cannot substitute shadow mapping)

Resources
- webgpu samples shadows
- tojidev webgpu cascaded shadow maps

Note: depthBias cannot be set for point or line topologies. Do the shadow bias in the shader instead?

SpotLight shadows
- fov = 2 * theta_max
- aspect = 1
- use comparison sampler

remember: need to be able to specify a shadowCaster *independent* of a light source
  - maybe add light.disable?
  - for now can just set intensity to 0

babylon and THREE allow setting the shadowmap update frequency (so can decide to only render once for static geo)

BabylonJS
- need to create a shadow generator per light
- have to explicitly mark which meshes are to cast shadows from 
- have to explicitly mark when a mesh can receive shadows
```javscript
const shadowGenerator = new BABYLON.ShadowGenerator(1024, light);
shadowGenerator.getShadowMap().renderList.push(torus);
ground.receiveShadows = true;
```

Both Babylon and ThreeJS have on MESH
- bool receiveShadow

Things to test
- transparent casts shadow correctly
- alpha-cutout casts shadow correctly
  - how do other game engines do this???????? do i really need to run the entire fragment shader, seems like a waste
- changing scale on GLight doesn't mess up the shadow map
- backfaces/billboards cast and receive shadow correctly (e.g. backside of a GPlane)
- if mesh is out of light range, not affected by shadows

be okay with sloppy first version!!!

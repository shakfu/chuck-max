## [0.1.x]

- Defaults to Max 9 builds

- Updated chuck code base to `chuck 1.5.4.5-dev`

- Added `ConvRev.chug`, `FluidSynth.chug` and `Line.chug`

- Updated chuck code base and examples to `1.5.4.2-dev (chai)`

- Added MAX_VERSION env variable for MAX 9 compatibility

- Tested sucessfully on Max 9

- Updated chuck code base to `1.5.3.2-dev (chai)`

- Updated chuck code base to `1.5.2.6-dev (chai)`

- Added [pdf cheatsheet of chuck~ methods](https://github.com/shakfu/chuck-max/blob/main/media/chuck-max-cheatsheat.pdf)

- Changed `add` syntax: `add <filename:arg1:arg2:..:argN` is no longer allowed due to the ambiguity entailed by Max automatically adding volname prefixes such `Macintosh HD:`. Args must **only** be provided as Max-friendly space separated format: `add <filename> arg1 arg2 .. argN`

- Added `nomp3` build variant for a `full - mp3` build (works better on older macOS systems)

- Added Makefile-based packaging, codesigning and notarization.

## [0.1.2]

- Added a github workflow to automate building the external (no codesigning/notarizing yet)

- Added improved and simplified build guid in README

- Added improved build system using mostly homebrew via `make brew`

- Added test for .mp3 use by `WarpBuf`

- Added mp3 support to libsndfile-using chugins {`Fauck`, `WarpBuf`}

- Added alternative max-friendly style for `add` such that `<filename> arg1 arg2 .. argN` is interpretered as `<filename>:arg1:arg2:argN`

- Added tested for chuck `add` colon-separated args

- Added `ck_info`, `ck_warn`, `ck_debug` for more control and consistency wrt console logging.

- Removed `info` message and merged its functionality with `status` message.

- Reorganized `patchers/contrib` folder given prior bug fix.

- Fix for file searching bug bug which now makes it possible in the case of `[chuck~ 2 abc.ck]` for `abc.ck` to be in found in the same folder as the Max patch which references it.

- Thanks to Professor @gewang for [PR-16](https://github.com/shakfu/chuck-max/pull/16) which fixed the Faust 'crash-on-clone' issue!

- Added `eval` method for adding code from max messages and the textedit widget (see `test_eval.maxpat`).

## [0.1.1]

see [prerelease 0.1.1](https://github.com/shakfu/chuck-max/releases/tag/0.1.1)

- Added `run_needs_audio` attribute to ensure that adding or running shred can only happen when dsp is on.

- Added patcher directory to search paths for `add`ed chuck file.

- Added improved callback demos for global vars

- Changed `remove` message to able to take more than than one shred_id

- Added test for use of global variables and a practical test of its use in a musical patch.

- Fixed bug which prevented sending lists of atoms as chuck arrays.

- Improved path handling: run, add, replace, edit now all use same mechanism to check file validity, fix partial path if file is in `examples`, or otherwise search in Max search path.

- Changed / improved `chuck~.maxhelp` to make it clearer and more readable.

- Added `docs` message to open chuck documentation in browser

- Updated chuck code base to `1.5.2.5-dev (chai)`

- Added fallback search for file based on `locatefile_extended` if given path is not absolute or found in the `chuck-max/examples` folder.

- Added support for setting file and editor attributes, to facilitate use of external editor via setting inspector vars or via setting `editor <path>` and `edit <filename>`. Also double-clicking on the `chuck~` object will open the current file in the specified external editor.

- The`add` and `replace` messages now both handle chuck style file args:  `add <path>:<arg1>:<arg2>:<argN>`  While this is consistent without chuck treats file arguments, there is some thought to making this more readable and Max friendly in the future by dropping the colons to adopt the following style: `add <path> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>`

- Fixed `chuck~` object args to allow just the number of channels as args.

- Added midi player to .maxhelp to demonstrate midi file playback of `chuck~` from Max.

- Added `loglevel` / `loglevel <int>` message for setting chuck log level 0-10. Dropped redundant previous `debug` switch/attribute.

- Added a number of missing chuck messages: `add <filepath>`, `replace <shredID> <filepath>`, `reset id`, `clear vm`, `clear globals`, `time`, `status` along with their respective symbols: `+`, `-`, `--`, `=`, `^`, etc.

- Changed back to keeping all chugins in `chuck-max/examples/chugins` (alternative is to move chugins and faust stdlib to `support`)

- Added support for building the `Faust` or `Fauck` chugin with the `faust`
stdlib in `chuck-max/examples/faust`

- Added support for building the `WarpBuf` chugin

- Changed the content and structure of the `examples` folder to more closely resemble the updated chuck examples folder. See the `README.md` file in the folder for a more granular list of changes.

- For macOS, chugins are now installed in the external's `Resources/chugins` folder. The `chugins` folder in `examples` is still searched for chugins in any case

- Removed posix header includes and replaced with x-platform code in aid of eventual windows support

- Added callback mechanism and example

- Added examples for local and global event triggering

- Fixed the `sndbuf.ck` exmample (and added `sndbuf1.ck`) to demonstrate wav file playback via `SndBuf` with some samples

- Changed `signal` message name to `sig` as it conflicted with a global Max message `signal`

- Added optional channels argument which to set more channels at object creation

- Changed `info`: now shows `<object id> - <shred-id>`

- Added test for two object instances running simultaneously

- Added `info` message to list running shreds in the console

- Update to chuck 1.5.2.3-dev (chai)

## [0.1.0]

- Initial support for chuck 1.5.1.3

- Support for Linux

- Support for macOS
